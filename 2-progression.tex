\section{Background and Research Question}

\subsection{Background and research question}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Introduction to problem of climate change and requirement for decarbonization.
  \item Requirement of shift in heating, transport, and industry to electricity.
  \item Inability to use traditional machine learning and statistical tools to project into future due to rapid disruption.
  \item Use of long-term agent-based model to simulate into the future (eg. 2050) allowing policy makers and energy market players to assess effect of decisions made.
  \item Agent-based models can be used to model the impact of heterogenous investors
  \item Enable policy makers to assess the impact of market power and collusion
  \item Ability to use reinforcement learning to give agents intelligence
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Literature Review}

\begin{itemize}
  \item  Literature review on state-of-the-art models and applications
  \item Agent-based model tools
  \begin{enumerate}
  	\item Absence of open-source tool with stochasticity (table).
  \end{enumerate}

  \item Optimisation tools
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Work Completed}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Short-term load forecasting
  \item Completion of agent-based model at yearly granularity
  \item Results of yearly granularity of agent-based model
  \item Use of Northern Ireland scenario for optimisation of carbon tax using reinforcement learning (preliminary results)
\end{itemize}

\section{Remaining Work}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Increase granularity to hourly.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Selection of best representative days for long-term - Comparison to literature that selects best day for single year.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item  Parametrise model using genetic algorithm or other optimisation tool.

  \item Add intelligence to agents using reinforcement learning for:
  \begin{enumerate}
      \item Investment decisions.
      \item Bidding strategy.
      \item Impact of collusion (variable sharing between two or more agents).
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Comparison of optimisation and agent-based model in different scenarios.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Same intialisation parameters and project to future (form of cross-validation).
  \item Collusion.
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Further scenarios and results as examples
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Decreasing costs of technology over time
  \item Different countries
  \item Improving availability and capacity factors
  \item Uncertainty in fuel prices
  \item Changing demand curve shape due to increase in electric vehicles
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}
